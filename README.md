## Introduction

Are you working on a large Angular project and want to clean up unused components? Unused Components Checker is a lightweight tool that helps you identify Angular components that are not being used in your project. It checks whether the components are mentioned in the project's routes and if their selector tags are used in HTML files.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g unused-components-checker


Usage
Navigate to your Angular project's root directory and run:
npx unused-components-checker
or
node node_modules/unused-components-checker/unused-components-checker.js


Example Output
Used Components: [component1, component2]
Unused Components: [component3, component4]
